# Java Training: Toner Duplex Printing - Enforcing Encapsulation in Printer Class

## Overview
This project is a Java application designed to demonstrate the concept of encapsulation in object-oriented programming. It includes a Printer class that enforces encapsulation while managing toner levels and duplex printing functionality.

## Features
- Manage toner levels in a printer
- Support for duplex (double-sided) printing
- Enforce encapsulation to protect the Printer class's internal state
- Simple and easy-to-understand code for educational purposes

## Installation
To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/thillainirmal-tech/Java-Training-Toner-DuplexPrinting-EnforcingEncapsulation-in-PrinterClass.git
